      <h3>Understanding how pessaries can help with pelvic organ prolapse</h3>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="card col-6">
      <h2>What Are Pessaries?</h2>
      <p>Pessaries are silicone or PVC medical devices used in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. At Lambert Sports Clinic, we primarily use silicone pessaries for comfort and flexibility, though firmer PVC pessaries are available when clinically appropriate.

        These devices come in various shapes and sizes, carefully selected based on individual assessment to ensure optimal comfort and effectiveness for each patient. The right pessary can significantly improve quality of life by providing support to the pelvic organs and reducing symptoms associated with prolapse.

        Our specialist physiotherapist, Sharon Edwards, has extensive experience in selecting and fitting the most appropriate pessary for each individual's specific condition and anatomy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card col-6">
      <h2>How They're Used</h2>
      <p>Some women choose to wear pessaries all the time, while others use them as needed for specific activities or situations. The flexibility in usage allows for personalized treatment plans tailored to your lifestyle and needs.

          Pessaries complement other pelvic health treatments, including pelvic floor exercises, bowel care advice, and other therapeutic approaches to provide comprehensive care for pelvic organ prolapse.

          When properly fitted and maintained, pessaries can provide significant relief from prolapse symptoms such as pelvic pressure, urinary or bowel issues, and discomfort during physical activities. They serve as an effective non-surgical option for managing prolapse and improving quality of life.</p>

  <h2>Types of Pessaries</h2>

  <div class="row text-center">
