          <h2 class="abouttext container">About Sharon</h2>
          <p class="abouttext container">Sharon started her physiotherapy journey some 30 years ago, training at Kings College, London, completing her Honours program in physiotherapy. After some years working in the NHS and private practice she embarked on two postgraduate Masters at the University of Queensland, in Australia, in Manipulative Physiotherapy and Sports Physiotherapy. Following this she stayed in Brisbane and developed and expanded several private practises with a multidisciplinary team of health professionals. One clinic also included driving a converted motorhome, with 3 treatment rooms, to rural locations, to deliver physiotherapy to a rural community. </p> <p class="abouttextbutton container" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#reg-modal1">Read more.....</p>
